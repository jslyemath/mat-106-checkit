# CheckIt Bank for Number Systems and Operations

## Purpose

This repo is for MAT 106 - Number Systems and Operations at SUNY Oswego. It uses both the CheckIt system for online practice and a personal python-based script for local LaTeX generation.

## Warning

The file structure of this project is different from your typical CheckIt bank, due to the need to create more customized LaTeX files locally. If you have interest in using CheckIt directly for local printing, I would suggest moving the generation logic out of the pygenerator.py files and back into the generator.sage files.

## To-Dos

TODO: Find a better way to format explanation skills online.
