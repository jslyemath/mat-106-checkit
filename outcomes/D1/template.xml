            <p>Consider the number {{pv_dec_string}}. Identify and name each of the place values used in this number. Write these names using both a numerical label (e.g. "10s") and an English-word label (e.g. "tens"). Numeric labels must use fractions for values smaller than one.</p>

                <p>If one {{units_block_}} represents one unit, which type of block represents one tenth? Why? Relate your answer back to the base ten place value system.</p>

            <outtro>
                <p>It takes ten tenths to create a single unit. Likewise, it takes ten {{tenths_block_a}}s to create a single {{units_block_a}}. Thus, a {{tenths_block_a}} represents one tenth.</p>

            <outtro>
                <p>It takes one hundred hundredths to create a single unit. Likewise, it takes one hundred {{hundredths_block_a}}s to create a single {{units_block_a}}. Thus, a {{hundredths_block_a}} represents one hundredth. </p>

                <p>How do base-ten blocks physically demonstrate how a base-ten place value system works?</p>
            </content>
            <outtro>
                <p>In a base-ten place value system, each place value must be ten times the place value to its right. It takes ten units to make a long, ten longs to make a flat, and ten flats to make a large cube. Thus, the four types of base ten blocks can be used for any 4 consecutive base-ten place values. </p>
