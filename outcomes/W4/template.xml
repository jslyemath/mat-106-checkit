        <p>For each of the following, write a word problem which is best suited for the given context. Your word problem should be appropriate for elementary school students, use sentences with proper English grammar, and require only one operation for solving. You should not solve your word problems.</p>

                <p>Explain why your word problem for "{{expl_prob_1}}" is best suited for the "{{expl_prob_context_1}}" problem structure. Compare and contrast with one other similar problem structure which uses the same operations. Why would that other problem structure not be as appropriate as "{{expl_prob_context_1}}" for your particular word problem?</p>
