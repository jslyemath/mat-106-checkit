For each of the following, write a word problem which is best suited for the given problem structure. Your word problem should be appropriate for elementary school students, use sentences with proper English grammar, and require \textbf{only one} operation for solving. You should \textbf{not} solve your word problems.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \VAR{prob_1}

    \vfill
    \begin{ansenv}
        \VAR{ans_text_1}\\

        (This can be modeled by the equation $\VAR{ans_math_1}$.)
    \end{ansenv}
    \vfill

    \item \VAR{prob_2}

    \vfill
    \begin{ansenv}
        \VAR{ans_text_2}\\

        (This can be modeled by the equation $\VAR{ans_math_2}$.)
    \end{ansenv}
    \vfill

    \item \VAR{prob_3}

    \vfill
    \begin{ansenv}
        \VAR{ans_text_3}\\

        (This can be modeled by the equation $\VAR{ans_math_3}$.)
    \end{ansenv}
    \vfill

    \item \VAR{prob_4}

    \vfill
    \begin{ansenv}
        \VAR{ans_text_4}\\

        (This can be modeled by the equation $\VAR{ans_math_4}$.)
    \end{ansenv}

For each of the following, refer to your word problems from the other side of this paper.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Explain \textbf{why} your word problem for ``\VAR{expl_prob_1}'' is \textbf{best} suited for the ``\VAR{expl_prob_context_1}'' problem structure. \textbf{Compare and contrast} with one other similar problem structure. \textbf{Why} would that other problem structure not be as appropriate as that of ``\VAR{expl_prob_context_1}''?

    \vfill

    \item Explain \textbf{why} your word problem for ``\VAR{expl_prob_2}'' is \textbf{best} suited for the ``\VAR{expl_prob_context_2}'' problem structure. \textbf{Compare and contrast} with one other similar problem structure. \textbf{Why} would that other problem structure not be as appropriate as that of ``\VAR{expl_prob_context_2}''?
