\begin{enumerate}
    \item If one \VAR{units_block} represents one unit, which type of block represents one tenth? Why? Relate your answer back to the base ten place value system.

    \vspace{20pt}
    \begin{ansenv}
        It takes ten tenths to create a single unit. Likewise, it takes ten \VAR{tenths_block}s to create a single \VAR{units_block}. Thus, a \VAR{tenths_block} represents one tenth.
    \end{ansenv}

    \item If one \VAR{units_block} represents one unit, which type of block represents one hundredth? Why? Relate your answer back to the base ten place value system.

    \vspace{20pt}
    \begin{ansenv}
        It takes one hundred hundredths to create a single unit. Likewise, it takes one hundred \VAR{hundredths_block}s to create a single \VAR{units_block}. Thus, a \VAR{hundredths_block} represents one hundredth. 
    \end{ansenv}

    \item How do base-ten blocks physically demonstrate how a base-ten place value system works?

    \vspace{20pt}
    \begin{ansenv}
        In a base-ten place value system, each place value must be ten times the place value to its right. It takes ten units to make a long, ten longs to make a flat, and ten flats to make a large cube. Thus, the four types of base ten blocks can be used for any 4 consecutive base-ten place values.
    \end{ansenv}
