        <p>Determine if the number below is prime or composite. If it is prime, you must show all work from our prime testing method. If it is composite, you must defend your answer with the appropriate work and/or explanation.</p>

            <p>The questions below are meant to prompt you to fully explain why our class's method for testing primes is designed the way it is, and why it works. </p>

                <p>On the front side, you didn't test <m>{{the_number}}</m> for divisibility by every number from 1 to <m>{{the_number}}</m>. You should have only tested a few numbers. <em>Why?</em> What sort of numbers did you skip out on testing, and why were you allowed to skip them?</p>

                <p>At the end, either you claimed that <m>{{the_number}}</m> was prime, or that it was composite. How did your work bring you to this conclusion?</p>
