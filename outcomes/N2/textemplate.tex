Determine if the number $\VAR{the_number}$ is prime or composite. If it is prime, you must show all work from our prime testing method. If it is composite, you must defend your answer with the appropriate work and/or explanation.\\

Fully explain why our class's method for testing primes is designed the way it is, and why it works. Why do we test only the numbers that we do? Why are we able to test so few numbers? What allows us to claim that a number is prime (or composite) based on our test?
