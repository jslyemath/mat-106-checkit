Suppose your student submits the work shown below. \VAR{work_desc_1} $\VAR{work_math}$ \VAR{work_desc_2}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth} \strut\vspace*{-\baselineskip}\newline


\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is incorrect about the work shown here?\newline (Identify every incorrect step, not just the first.)

    \ans{\VAR{incorrect}}

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \item For \textbf{each} mistake, describe why the student made that mistake. What were they probably thinking? What was their reasoning?

    \item What feedback would you give this student? Your feedback should not only give the correct steps to take, but also address their misconceptions.
