                <p><em>Why</em> did you chose <em>each</em> mathematical operation you chose? (For example, if you added numbers together, how did you know that addition was the operation most suitable for the situation?)</p>

                <p>Now, help a hypothetical student understand your mathematical operation choices more generally. How should a student <em>know to choose</em> each mathematical operation you chose -- not just for this word problem, but for future problems with potentially different wording?</p>

                <p>You probably performed more than one mathematical operation. Explain why you performed each step of your solution in the <em>order</em> that you did. Why did each operation come before or after then next?</p>
