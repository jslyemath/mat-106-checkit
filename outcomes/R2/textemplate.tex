% Fully explain your solution process to the problem on the reverse side of this paper by answering the following questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Why} did you chose \textbf{each} mathematical operation you chose? (For example, if you added numbers together, how did you know that addition was the operation most suitable for the situation?)

%     \vfill

%     \item Now, help a hypothetical student understand your mathematical operation choices more generally. How should a student \textbf{know to choose} each mathematical operation you chose -- not just for this word problem, but for future problems with potentially different wording?

%     \vfill

%     \item You probably performed more than one mathematical operation. Explain why you performed each step of your solution in the \textbf{order} that you did. Why did each operation come before or after then next?
