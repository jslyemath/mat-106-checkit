Solve the word problem below. You must show all work in order to pass. Do not forget to state your final answer, including any appropriate units.

Fully explain your solution process to the problem on the reverse side of this paper by answering the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Why} did you chose \textbf{each} mathematical operation you chose? (For example, if you added numbers together, how did you know that addition was the operation most suitable for the situation?)

    \vfill

    \item Now, help a hypothetical student understand your mathematical operation choices more generally. How should a student \textbf{know to choose} each mathematical operation you chose -- not just for this word problem, but for future problems with potentially different wording?

    \vfill

    \item You probably performed more than one mathematical operation. Explain why you performed each step of your solution in the \textbf{order} that you did. Why did each operation come before or after then next?
